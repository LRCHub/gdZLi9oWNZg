Right in the night, right in the night
Ain't it cool
Rolling it high, rolling it high
Ain't it cool
She's lookin' hot, she's lookin' hot
In the breeze
Flashin' those eyes struck in her stuff
Givenchi
Sure got the look and that good thing's here for free
Baby I'm not expensive but tonight don't trick at me
Sure got the look and you're right next to me
Dynamite! Dynamite!
Sure got the look got to keep you on my hook
Pussy cat eyes, I'm picking you
Sure you got the look
Right in the night you know that she's dynamite
Come on (dynamite! dynamite!)
Right in the night, right in the night
Ain't it cool
Right in the night, right in the night
She's no fool
Rolling it high, rolling it high
That's her thing
Right in the night she's cold as ice
Watch her step
Sure got the look and that good thing's here for free
Baby I'm not expensive but tonight don't trick at me
Sure got the look and you're right next to me
Dynamite! Dynamite!
Sure got the look got to keep you on my hook
Pussy cat eyes, I'm picking you
Girl you got the look
You know baby
You've got that dynamite
Baby
I want you're dynamite
Baby
You've got that dynamite
Baby
I want you're dynamite
Sure got the look and that good thing's here for free
Baby I'm not expensive but tonight don't trick at me
You sure got the look and you're right next to me
Dynamite! Baby you're dynamite
Sure got the look got to keep you on my hook
Pusy cat eyes, I'm picking you
Girl you got the look
Right in the night you know that she's dynamite
Come on (dynamite! dynamite!)
Oh this dynamite love, dynamite love
Brighter than moon has me slip through the city streets
Dynamite love, dynamite love
You're holding me can't believe that you're having doubts
